Changes in Version 4.3-2

  o Added an optional character entity reference processing to tth()
    and ttm(). Thus, to unify how character entities are referenced
    a particular mode ("named", "hex", or "dec") can be enfored. For
    example, the "GREEK SMALL LETTER MU" can be referenced as
    &mu; (or &mgr;) in "named" mode, or &#x03BC; (hex) or &#956; (dec).


Changes in Version 4.3-1

  o The argument "L" in tth.control() can now also be a character
    for the base file (no extension) for LaTeX auxiliary input.


Changes in Version 4.03-0

  o First CRAN release of R package "tth" with wrappers to the
    TeX-to-HTML converter tth() and the TeX-to-HTML/MathML
    converter ttm() from the TtH project of Ian H. Hutchinson,
    see http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/.
    
  o Both C code and R wrappers are distributed under the GPL-2,
    see the README file in the R source package for more details.
